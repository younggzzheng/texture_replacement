%% Algorithm

% TODO: implement
% To generate the texture we need a sample frame that clearly shows the
% surrounding texture around the marker, and we need to determine the
% homography. We'll use a customized texture synthesis to cover the hole
% and save that texture for later use. (Ilan can take care of this part.)
%
% general loop:
%   1. Find homography between marker and its location in the vide frame (Young?)
%   2. Composite synthesized texture onto frame (Ilan?)
